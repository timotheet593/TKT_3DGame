I added background music that loops as the game progressess. 
Yay sound effect when you beat a sectio and it resets your position.
Jump sound effect
Walls at the end of each section to indicate that you win.
A secret easter egg hidden in the map.
When you fall off the map you reset into the inital position.
I design the success walls on after effects since I am familiar with that software.
I added the scripts for all the resetting and sound effects.

I learned alot about how coding works in unity. 
I am familiar with putting scripts on objects and tying in audio from different soruces when a script gets run. 
I now know how to reset characters and play sound effects when certain events happen.


If anyone beats all three levels in a row with video proof I will send them 20 dollars.
